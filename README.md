# Python_Movies_Industry_EDA

This repository features an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of 1,000+ movies, uncovering trends in budgets, genres, and profitability to help guide movie studio decisions.

## Project Overview

Our hypothetical company aims to enter the movie industry by establishing a studio, but they lack industry knowledge. My objective is to gather, clean, and analyze movie data from various sources to offer recommendations that will help ensure their success in the film market.

## Python Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations and data handling.
- **seaborn**: For data visualization and statistical graphics.
- **matplotlib**: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
- **datetime**: For handling date and time data.

## Conclusion

While numerous factors could be analyzed in the future, we believe that these eight conclusions will significantly contribute to our companyâ€™s success in the movie industry:

1. **Budget Recommendation**: Allocate approximately $82,250,000 for movie production, which is expected to yield a profit margin exceeding 80%.

2. **Genre Focus**: Concentrate on the six most profitable genres: Adventure, Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, and Animation. Special emphasis should be placed on Sci-Fi and Animation due to lower competition and higher profit potential.

3. **Release Timing**: Schedule the majority of movie releases, especially Animation, during the summer months. Adventure, Drama, and Comedy films can also perform well if released in November, but summer remains the primary recommendation.

4. **Casting and Crew Selection**: Prioritize hiring individuals who consistently achieve a VAR score of at least 1.0, as they are likely to enhance the overall quality of the production.

5. **Oscar-Winning Potential**: Invest at least $35,465,000 to increase the chances of producing an Oscar-winning film.

6. **Rating Considerations**: Pay attention to movie ratings based on genre and target audience. For Animation, a G or PG rating is advisable, while PG-13 is optimal for other genres. Additionally, runtime has little correlation with overall profitability.

7. **Profitability Goals**: Aim for a profit margin of 66% and a net profit exceeding $50 million per movie to effectively compete with leading studios.

8. **Industry Research**: Investigate Disney's best practices to leverage the success of this established studio and inform our strategies moving forward.
